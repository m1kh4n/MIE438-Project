# MIE438 Project - Automated Color Sorter
Contributors: Vincent Po Chou, Sidanth Moolyali, Mohammad Ishaq Khan
Description: For our MIE438 course project, we developed a simplified software prototype of an industrial sorter. Our design utilizes a raspberry pi microprocessor in combination with a camera to recognize colors using openCV libraries. The recognized object is then sorted into its respective color bin with the help of the 4 DC motors driven by the raspberry pi that operate the arms for the individual bins.
